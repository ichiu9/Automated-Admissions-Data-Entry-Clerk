# Automated Admissions Data Entry Clerk

The process of renaming application documents is a task that Westmont Admissions Data Entry Clerks spend countless hours
on. The Automated Admissions Data Entry Clerk (AADEC) is a tool to automate the renaming process as it analyzes and         classifies prospective studentsâ€™ letters of recommendations, transcripts, school profiles, and so forth. The AADEC's data   cleaning and extraction are handled by standard bash scripting, while the data analysis is done by the natural language     processing (NLP) service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) which utilizes machine learning to classify the letters of rec.     The entire workflow of the project will soon be compiled into a user friendly desktop application or easily executable  file.
